MVC4OAuthAPISamples
===================

Implementations for oAuth against various providers using MVC4. If you only want to sign in then you can work with the default MVC oAuth libraries. If you wish to get other data or make API calls, then you need to DIY.

Existing provider detail and doco are very confusing and many libraries are even more complex and confusing. In short, developers are required to do too much work to make it useful.

The purpose of this library is a "How to get things done" set of samples using whatever is the best way of doing it in my experience.

You will find oAuth signin and oAuth API queries for :

- Twitter
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Google
- Microsoft

More coming when i find the time.
